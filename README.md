<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Here! is a video conference platform designed for educational needs of students and instructors. On top of the general characteristics of a video conferencing application, it includes additional practical educational tools. There is a virtual TA tool that uses motion tracking and object detection to analyze videos of students to generate summary information about the class attention, as well as to provide real time feedback to students and teachers. Other features are simultaneous note taking and slide-sharing. Note taking allows students to take notes and screenshots during the lecture and save them. Slide sharing allows students to navigate through the slides independently from the instructor, and then they can sync back with the instructor. Together, they make online education more reliable, informative and easy.

Our amazing features:
* AI Teaching Assistant: Teaching assistant is always there to keep students focused and notify instructors. It makes classes more interactive!
* Slide Sharing: Students can backtrack anytime on slides, no more "Sir, can you please go back two slides?"!
* Note Taking: Students can take notes during class on their own whiteboard. They can even draw on it!
